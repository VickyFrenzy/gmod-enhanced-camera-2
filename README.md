Garry's Mod: Enhanced Camera 2
============================

* [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=678037029)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/VictorienXP/gmod-enhanced-camera-2)

What is it?
-----------

The original [Enhanced Camera](https://github.com/elizagamedev/gmod-enhanced-camera) was not maintained anymore and had a lot of issues. So here is **Enhanced Camera 2**, the fixed and improved version of the [Enhanced Camera](https://github.com/elizagamedev/gmod-enhanced-camera).

Enhanced Camera, based off the Oblivion/Skyrim/Fallout mods of the same name, is an addon for Garry's Mod that allows players to see their own bodies. The source code was originally based on [Gmod Legs 3](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=112806637), but has been modified so extensively and the two now have little in common besides a similar goal. It can be considered in a beta state.

Why not Gmod Legs/Immersive First-Person?
-----------------------------------------

Gmod Legs, as the title suggests, only shows the player's legs. It also requires a server-side component to work properly. [Immersive First-Person](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=133042891) is entirely client-side, but doesn't use viewmodels, modifies the camera origin (and thus breaks aiming), and either requires a strict camera pitch restriction or suffers a lot of clipping. Enhanced Camera, like the Oblivion/Skyrim/Fallout mods of the same name, combines the viewmodel and worldmodel and does not modify the camera origin.

What this addon can and cannot do
---------------------------------

Enhanced Camera *can*:

* Work on the client-side, even on servers without the addon installed, as long as `sv_allowcslua` is enabled
* Dynamically change the player's height to match their model if the serverside component is installed

Enhanced Camera *can not*:

* Work 100% of the time if models have broken paths unless the optional serverside component is installed, though it works most of the time
* Show your PAC3 customizations (yet!)
* Show your shadow (you can use `cl_drawownshadow` if you want, but it won't match your first person body or show your weapon's shadow)

Console Commands and cvars
